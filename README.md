# Library Management System

The Library Management System is a web-based application built using Java and the Spring framework. It provides a platform for managing the operations of a library, including book cataloging, member management, book borrowing and returning, and generating reports.

## Features

- User registration and authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and access different functionalities based on their roles (e.g., librarian, member).
- Book management: Books can be cataloged with details such as title, author, genre, and availability status.
- Member management: Members can be registered, updated, and tracked within the system.
- Book borrowing and returning: Users can borrow and return books, with validation and due date calculations.
- Search and filtering: Books can be searched based on different criteria, such as title, author, or genre.
- Reports and statistics: Reports can be generated on borrowed books, popular genres, or overdue books.

## Database

This project uses MySQL as the database for data persistence. Make sure you have MySQL installed and create a database named `library_management_system` before running the application.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard package structure:

- `com.example.librarymanagement`: Main package
  - `com.example.librarymanagement.controllers`: Contains the controllers for handling different HTTP requests.
  - `com.example.librarymanagement.services`: Includes the service classes for business logic.
  - `com.example.librarymanagement.repositories`: Contains the repositories for data access.
  - `com.example.librarymanagement.models`: Defines the entity models used in the application.
  - `com.example.librarymanagement.views`: Contains the Thymeleaf view templates.

## Usage

To run the Library Management System locally, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Java and MySQL installed on your machine.
2. Create a database named `library_management_system` in MySQL.
3. Clone this repository to your local machine.
4. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
5. Modify the `application.properties` file in the `src/main/resources` directory with your MySQL database credentials.
6. Build and run the application.
7. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Future Enhancements
